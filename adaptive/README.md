# From MICROSAR Adaptive delivery to simulation with CANoe

[Currently under development]

This page will guide you on how to use CANoe as a test tool for an adaptive application, that is built based on a MICROSAR Adaptive BSW Package. A MICROSAR Adaptive delivery contains some examples. We will use the start application, connect it to CANoe using the Vector SIL Kit Adapters TAP and simulate parts of it with CANoe's toolbox.
